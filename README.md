# REACT TETRIS

This project made by React was built with the help of FreeCodeCamp. The code is a fully functional Tetris game made with React Hooks.

I wanted to build this game with the intention of learning more about React Hooks, making styled components that are properly mapped, and using arrays to build shapes in code.

I learned not only how to utilize React Hooks, but to set key codes, structure future React projects where I can import various hook files from a specialized "hooks" foler, and setting motion for items on an application.

## Future Plans

I want to strengthen this application with more features.

1. Most importantly, I want users to pause the game so they can take a break.

2. Another feature to add would be to add a preview window for the next Tetromino. Planning your rows is the most important part of Tetris, so letting users see the next block to come would be very helpful.

I hope to improve upon this project by adding more features such as a hard drop that brings down Tetrominos to the bottom rapidly, and pausing to keep pacing comfortable.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
